    <p><b>INGREDIENTS</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large potato, cut into chunky chips, skin left on</li>
        <li>1 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>125 ml beef stock</li>
        <li>2 heaped tbsp extra thick double cream</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></p>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put 1 tbsp oil in a small roasting tin and heat up in the oven. Boil the potatoes in salted water for 3 mins before draining and letting steam-dry for a few mins. Season, carefully toss in the hot oil and cook for 30-35 mins until crisp and golden.</li></p>
        <p><li>When the chips are nearly done, heat the rest of the oil in a frying pan. Season the steak with lots of freshly ground pepper and a little salt, then fry for 2-3 mins on each side, depending on how rare you like it. Rest for 5 mins while you make the sauce.</li></p>
        <p><li>Pour excess oil from the pan and add the vinegar. Bubble, then add the stock and boil until reduced by half. Stir through the cream, bubbling to thicken a little, then add as much extra pepper as you like. Serve with steak, chips and peas.</li></p>
    </ol>
