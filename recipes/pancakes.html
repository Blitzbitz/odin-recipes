    <OL>
        <P><LI>Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder. baking soda and salt in a  large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.
        </LI></p>
        <li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).
        <p> (The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick -- doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly -- fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency).
        </p></li>
        <p><li>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. 
        </li></p>
        <p><li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
        </li></p> 
        <p><li>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!
