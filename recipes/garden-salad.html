    <p><b>INGREDIENTS</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>500g new potatoes</li>
        <li>350g runner beans</li>
        <li>1 bunch of spring onions</li>
        <li>240g sunblushed\sundried tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>200g Wensleydale cheese</li>
        <li>15g fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>4-5 tbsp honey and mustard dressing</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></p>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Slice the potatoes and cook them in a large pan of salted boiling water for 7 minutes. While theyâ€™re cooking, trim and diagonally slice the runner beans and chop the spring onions. Add the beans to the pan and cook for a further 7-9 minutes, until the potatoes and beans are just tender.</li></p>
        <p><li>Drain the veg and run under cold water to halt the cooking. Shake the colander to get rid of as much water as possible, then tip into a large bowl. Add the onions and tomatoes, crumble in the cheese and mix well.</li></p>
        <p><li>Add most of the mint and dressing and toss everything lightly together. Tip into a serving dish, drizzle with a little more dressing and scatter over the rest of the mint.</li></p>
